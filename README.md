# Welcome to Red Sky
Red sky at night, sailors' delight. Red sky in the morn', sailors' forlorn

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a one-stop-shop to get a yes/no answer for whether any given stock will rise or fall the next business day.

Red Sky will integrate machine learning using multiple data scources and in-house domain knowledge to provide perform robust contextual analysis on a daily basis.

News articles, historical stock performance, social media sentiment, etc. will be combined to produce a single output probability to answer the binary question: **Will the stock rise or fall the next day?**
